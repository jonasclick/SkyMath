# SkyMath

SkyMath is a mental math training app for sailplane pilots. SkyMath is written for iPhone in Swift mostly using **UIKit** and includes a **widget** for quick access from the lock screen of the iPhone.

I specifically made SkyMath to get experience with UIKit which is Swift's older UI framework. Although SwiftUI has some key advantages, UIKit is still widely used in iOS Apps as it offers a lot more control over the UI and is therefore still important to know, even in 2025 :-)

## Key Features

- ðŸ“± **UIKit-Based UI** â€“ Built using UIKit for precise and efficient interface control.
- ðŸ§® **Custom Math Trainer** â€“ Generates tailored math problems to challenge users.
- ðŸ”¢ **Instant Submit** â€“ Submits the answer automatically when entered correctly for efficient practice sessions
- ðŸ“Š **Score Tracking** â€“ Collect points with every correct answer.
- ðŸ”’ **Lock Screen Widget** â€“ Get in a few reps when on the go: Quick access from your lock screen.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift** â€“ Swift is Apple's type-safe language which is used as the primary language in this project.
- **UIKit** as the UI-framework. It uses an imperative programming style vs. SwiftUI which is newer and declarative.
- **Lock Screen Widget** following Apple's guideline for how lock screen widget should be coded.
- **UserDefaults** â€“ Persistent storage for tracking user progress.

## Exercise types

SkyMath features exercises for these most commonly used calculations by sailplane pilots:

 - Convert altitudes from feet to meters (ft to m)
 - Convert altitudes from flight level to meters (FL to m)
 - Convert speeds from knots to km/h (kt to km/h)
 - Convert distances from nautical miles to kilometers (NM to km)
 - Calculate opposite headings (Heading)
 - And practice the three times table (if you're super fast at it your altitude conversions will be faster, too.)
